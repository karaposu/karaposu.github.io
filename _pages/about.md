About me
========
AI Solutions Engineer, Data Scientist, Backend SWE


I see myself as a builder. If you’re the right kind of person, that word probably already means something to you. I enjoy every part of building, not just knowing things or executing tasks, but talking things through, shaping ideas, and working together to solve problems in a way that’s actually enjoyable. Being a builder has naturally pushed me into wearing many hats at once: data scientist, backend developer, project manager, and product owner.

I also work at the level of concept engineering, shaping new mental models, systems, and approaches before they exist, then translating them into something real and usable. This is where I see my long-term value in an AI-enabled future, where implementation is becoming increasingly accessible.

I also love the philosophy of open source and am determined to leave my tiny contribution in various forms to the open-source world. I enjoy the company of people with a similar mindset and thrive in collaborative environments.

Previously I obtained my Master's degree in Big Data & AI in [Novosibirsk State University](https://english.nsu.ru).
