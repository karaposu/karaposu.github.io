About me
========
My research interest is Face Analysis for Augmented Reality Applications and deep CNN interpretations. 

Previously I obtained my Master's degree in Big Data & AI in [Novosibirsk State University](https://www.mines-stetienne.fr/en/). In 2018, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in biomedical engineering from [Kocaeli University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/), Turkey.
